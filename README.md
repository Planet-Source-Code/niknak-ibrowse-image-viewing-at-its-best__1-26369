### Description

Ibrowse is a complete Image viewing suite. It opens a range of images, from Bitmaps to JPG's right round to Windows Metafiles. Ibrowse can open up individual images or turn a whole folder into a slideshow which can then be made into a full screen slideshow and is a MUST see. As well as that Ibrowse can also display thumbnails of folders which is very handy indeed. Anyways I love this program I hope you do to, it looks nice and does the job very well so please download it and then vote for it, im allways voting for people its about time some people returned the favour!
